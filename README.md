This is a project that helped me learn the backend part of the JavaScript language while I was building it. It is also used to showcase the projects I've built and tell people a little bit about me.

Style changes:
I added a zoom in effect for the thumbnail project images on the "My Portfolio" page.

I changes the font-family of the "My Portfolio" heading.

I changed the color of the "LEARN MORE" text to a lighter grey and I changed the color to white when the mouse hovers over it.

I have more style changes than this. You can see some more of them in the public\css\custom.css file.
