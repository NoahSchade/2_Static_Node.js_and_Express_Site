        | Some of these projects were completed during 8 units of the full stack JavaScript techdegree Program at teamtreehouse.com. The full stack JavaScript techdegree is meant to train students in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, API, React, Node.js, Express, Pug, Sequelize, SQL, Databases, Git, and GitHub. Other projects were completed in the Advanced CSS and Sass course at Udemy.com which taught me some more animations in CSS, advanced responsive design, SASS architecture, a lot of cool CSS effects, flexbox, custom CSS properties, masks, SVGs, CSS grid and more.
